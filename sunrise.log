His victims were allegedly told to send photos of their bare chests to him via Facebook Messenger, police say..  Visa exemption between Singapore, Myanmar to kick in end-2016.  The announcement comes as Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong kicks off his three-day official visit to Myanmar..  Intellectually disabled man pleads guilty to attempted rape of 4-year-old step-niece.  The 22-year-old man confessed to the police that he had tried to rape his step-niece as he was feeling “horny” after her 4-year-old step-niece straddled him, wanting to play..  Can Singapore stay clean when banks play dirty for wealthy clients?.  Being a private banking hub exposes the city-state to tainted money, analysts tell Money Mind. But bankers have been sent a strong message to play by compliance rules - or else..     Thats all for now.  Have a nice day.
